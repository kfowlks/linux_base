These are my baseline configuration files for my embedded Linux based devices. Often in my home network, I perfer enabling the Avahi mDNS support so my devices can be addressed via their hostname e.g. pine64.local

In order to do this you will need to install software on the clients as well

Windows - Download Bonjour Print Services for Windows v2.0.2 ()
Linux  -  avahi-daemon package

Features

Zero config settings (Avahi Setup) AKA Apple Bonjour
